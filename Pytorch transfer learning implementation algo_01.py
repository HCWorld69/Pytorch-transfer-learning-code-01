My code which trains a neural network to approximate the solution of the differential equation:

 
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

# Define the neural network
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc1 = nn.Linear(2, 64)
        self.fc2 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc3 = nn.Linear(64, 64)
        self.fc4 = nn.Linear(64, 1)
    def forward(self, x):
        x = torch.relu(self.fc1(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc2(x))
        x = torch.relu(self.fc3(x))
        x = self.fc4(x)
        return x

# Generate training data
x = np.linspace(0, np.pi, num=100)
t = np.linspace(0, 5, num=100)
X, T = np.meshgrid(x, t)
Y = np.sin(X)**2 * np.exp(-2*T)
Y = Y.reshape(-1, 1)

# Convert to PyTorch tensors
X = torch.from_numpy(X).float()
T = torch.from_numpy(T).float()
Y = torch.from_numpy(Y).float()
inputs = torch.cat((X, T), dim=1)

# Train the neural network
model = Net()
criterion = nn.MSELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.01)
for epoch in range(500):
    output = model(inputs)
    loss = criterion(output, Y)
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

# Plot the results
plt.imshow(output.detach().numpy().reshape(100, 100), extent=[0, np.pi, 0, 5], origin='lower')
plt.xlabel('x')
plt.ylabel('t')
plt.title('Heat flow in a wire')
plt.show()



This code trains a neural network to approximate the solution of the heat flow equation by minimizing the mean squared error between the neural network output and the exact solution. The trained model can then be used to plot the approximate solution. Note that this is just one example of how you can use transfer learning with PyTorch to solve a differential equation, and the actual accuracy of the solution may depend on various factors such as the choice of network architecture, training data, and optimization algorithm.
